 Instructions: Use the "Add to Party" to add that character to the party list. Each character has a class, role, and level -- you can filter by class or role, or aggregate by level (ascending or descending). You can reset the filters with the reset button!
 Bugs: not a bug but you can only reset cart upon reload of page.
